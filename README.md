# Currency-and-Denominations-Converter

Our project is based on creating an application that takes an amount as an input from the user and then uses the greedy technique to find out what is the most optimal number of denominations needed to get the entered amount. 
This project was created by my team and I as the miniproject for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course, in the fourth semester of my undergrad CSE course.
We have implemented the code in two languages for our project, namely C and Python. 
The code that works on Python has a Graphical User Interface that is user-friendly and can find out the most optimal denominations for four currencies: INR, USD, EUR, and AED.
The code that works on C, was developed on Code-Blocks IDE and has a currency converter that converts different currencies (USD, EUR, AED) to INR depending on the exchange rates (as of 6th June 2021) and then prints the most optim
optimal denominations in INR.
